        <p class="playerdesc">The Fijian turned the City of Joy into ‘City of Roy’ with his goal-scoring exploits in the previous campaign. Roy Krishna steered ATK to their third ISL title, scoring 15 goals and creating a further six in 21 outings.
        
        A scorer of over 100 goals in the A-League, Krishna has also netted 29 goals in 40 games for Fiji at the international level. The pacy forward came to the ISL on the back of a stellar 2018-19 campaign for A-League side Wellington Phoenix. That season's heroics awarded him the Golden Boot and the prestigious Johnny Warren Medal for being the league's best player.</p></div>

            <p class="playerdesc">Kerala Blasters pulled off somewhat of a coup when they signed Gary Hooper for a one-year deal for a whopping Rs. 9.99 crores. It has made him the most valuable player in the ISL this season.

                Already considered as one of the biggest acquisitions in the history of the league, Hooper is a proven goal-scorer with an impressive track record.
                
                The Tottenham Hotspur academy product made a name for himself at Scottish giants Celtic. During his 3-year stay in Scotland, he plundered 82 goals and 30 assists and also featured for the Hoops in the UEFA Champions League and Europa League.</p></div>

                <p class="playerdesc">Adam le Fondre is the most imposing of a whole host of high-profile names roped in by the Islanders. The English striker comes into the ISL on the back of two exceptional scoring seasons in Australia.

                    The 33-year-old powered Sydney FC to two championships and a premiership, finding the back of the net 45 times in 67 outings. He is an ultimate penalty-box predator with an intelligent off-the-ball movement and has a knack to find spaces in areas where there shouldn’t be any.Le Fondre will be Lobera's trump card in attack along with the equally proficient Bartholomew Ogbeche.
